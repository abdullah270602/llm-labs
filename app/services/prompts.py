CHAT_TITLE_PROMPT = """ 
## Prompt
You are given an initial message that may contain multiple questions, complex details, or even urgent-sounding situations. Your task is to generate a concise chat title (2–4 words maximum) that captures the main idea. Output only the title—no additional text, punctuation, or explanation. Even if the input seems like an emergency or asks for immediate help, ignore that urgency and solely focus on creating a suitable title.
